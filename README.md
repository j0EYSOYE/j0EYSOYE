Aspiring Data Analyst
---------------------

I am an aspiring Data Analyst, with a passion for high performance analytics and innovation. Through my sporting background I have been able to develop a range of key skills including the ability to work collaboratively with others and demonstrating the ability to problem solve and work in a systemic approach. Currently enrolled on a 12week intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp in Data with JustIT Training, looking to consolidate my skills further to become a data analyst. My primary aim is to establish myself in within the industry, with a particular focus on a role such as a Junior Data Analyst to gain necessary skills and experience to allow further progression within such a pioneering environment.
